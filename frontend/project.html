                                    Sina-flex is a surgical robot for performing laparoscopic surgeries and has been
                                    designed and fabricated at Sina medical and Robotics Co. Like all the robots,
                                    precision is one of the main concerns and it's varies based on the application.
                                    Sina-flex has three serial DOF and two parallel DOF. The end of the tool is
                                    snakeskin robots, which impairs the calibration process. Because of the relatively
                                    high error, the calibration of the Sina robot started.
                                    The classical methods were not very practical in this project, and the Genetic
                                    Algorithms (GA) and Neural Networks (NN), which are the newer and more accurate
                                    methods, were used in this project.

                                    The reason for using both Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks was to investigate
                                    the behavior of the system after calibration in different ways. Optimization is a
                                    model-depended. However, Neural Networks is a model-independent. In the genetic
                                    method, the goal is to update the DH parameters, although in the Neural Network, the
                                    goal is only to find a relation between inputs and outputs.
                                    The test was performed in four steps. The first step was the calibration of the
                                    first three serial DOF, the second step was the calibration of the parallel part of
                                    the robot known as the agile eye, the third part was the laparoscopic tool
                                    calibration alone ,and last, the overall performance of the robot after the separate
                                    calibration of each part was checked. In the end, the inverse kinematics of the
                                    robot must also be computed, which can also be found by the neural network and
                                    partial derivation method.
                                    Results were impressive and precision enhanced more than 90 percent. Results of this
                                    project will be published soon.

                                    The purpose of the project was to design a PID controller for a Walker robot that
                                    helps humans walk along a straight and curved path. The walker has two wheels with a
                                    torque control as an input.
                                    To accomplish this project, it was first necessary to calculate the expected path by
                                    solving the LIPM equations. The control was then designed to minimize the
                                    interactive force between the human and Walker-Robot. One of the challenges of this
                                    project was the design of two input-output controlling system, which was done by
                                    MATLAB Simulink.
                                    The PID controller has been designed and some of the results are shown below.

                                    The robotic finger has been designed in Solidworks and simulated in ADAMS. Some
                                    prototypes have been fabricated for the project and in each prototype the model has
                                    improved. As the first serious project for me, Yasin helped me to be more familiar
                                    with the manufacturing process such as machining and the process of fabricating a
                                    model. The finger was designed and fabricated and results were acceptable.

                                    The design is inspired by one of the greatest conducted robotic hands. DLRIII is one
                                    of the most beautiful and complicated robots. The main purpose of the project is to
                                    improve the construction of the design. The goal was decreasing the complexity and
                                    reducing the cost of the construction. The goal is achieved by decreasing the number
                                    of motors and altering the design. By using a cheaper fabricating process like
                                    3D-printers, the cost of the fabrication diminished.

                            Abstract- Dexterous robotic hands are not very popular in production lines. Complexity in
                            mechanism and operation makes such hands less appealing for conventional industrial
                            applications. In this paper,
                            a structurally simple robotic finger with 3 degrees of freedom, named Yasin is designed and
                            fabricated. Compared to other similar designs, the new mechanism is less complicated to
                            build and maintain, and is better suited for control purposes in low-cost applications.

                            This project was completed pertaining to the lesson for measuring instruments. The project
                            was about calibrating the sensor to measure the ambient temperature. After a great
                            collaboration with my team members and getting more than a hundred data points the results
                            were astonishing. The sensor's accuracy was 0.1 °C. An NTC thermistor was used which had a
                            negative resistance coefficient.

                            are not particularly limited to those tasks. This project helped us learn how to make
